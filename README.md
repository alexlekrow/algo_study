# Algorithms and Data Structures Refresh Study

Refreshing algorithms and data structure knowledge, this repo will hold examples so that I can quickly grok, review and comment gotchas for different code examples.

All examples will be done in python, this is primarily to make myself more comfortable with the language for use in interviews. My most comfortable languages do not allow enough flexability for me to use consistently for coding problems in all domains. Python is the best general purpose language their is.

I will review all examples and take detailed analysis notes in README files throughout the repo.
