# Algorithms and Data Structures Refresh Study

Refreshing algorithms and data structure knowledge, this repo will hold examples so that I can quickly grok, review and comment gotchas for different code examples.

All examples will be done in python and/or rust, this is primarily to make myself more comfortable with these languages for use in interviews. My (currently) most comfortable languages do not allow enough flexability for me to use consistently for coding problems in all domains. Python and Rust both offer good out of the box flexibility and power when needed.

I will review all examples and take detailed analysis notes in README files throughout the repo.

## Topics Covered

To fully prepare make sure that you understand how to use and implement all of the following, and know the space/time complexity where applicable.

**NOTE:** Practicing on paper before coding implementations can help you better learn the internals without relying on code completion tools.

### Data Structures
* Linked Lists
* Trees, Tries & Graphs
* Stacks & Queues
* Heaps
* Vectors / ArrayLists
* **Hash Tables**

### Algorithms
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

### Concepts
* Bit Manipulation
* Memory ( Stack v. Heap)
* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming
* Big O Time & Space

## Interview Quick Reference
The following concepts are hacks that can be memorized to potentially be useful for some quests.

### Useful Powers of 2 Table
