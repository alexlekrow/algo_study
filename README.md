# Algorithms and Data Structures Refresh Study

Refreshing algorithms and data structure knowledge, this repo will hold examples so that I can quickly grok, review and comment gotchas for different code examples.

All examples will be done in python and/or rust, this is primarily to make myself more comfortable with these languages for use in interviews. My (currently) most comfortable languages do not allow enough flexability for me to use consistently for coding problems in all domains. Python and Rust both offer good out of the box flexibility and power when needed.

I will review all examples and take detailed analysis notes in README files throughout the repo.
