# Technical Interview Workbook

## Study Stategy

## Phase 1

## 
Start Chapter 1 of CTCI for **Phase 1** and progress to 

Work will be done in C++ ( Strongest language, and most low level ).

### Part 3

Review each data structure for each language to strengthen mental correlation between programming languages and how their concepts are simialar or differ.

## Phase 2 - Concepts and Algorithms



## Phase 3 - Knowledge Base

## Phase 4 - Review Problems

## Phase 5 - 

Phase 6 - Grind LeetCode with all 3 languages, timed solves (20/mediusm), (


### Key Methods

** Spaced Repetition (Distributed Practice) - By working on the material in 3 seperate phases.
** Practice Testing - By working through the following topics.

## Topics Covered

To fully prepare make sure that you understand how to use and implement all of the following, and know the space/time complexity where applicable.

> **NOTE:** Practicing on paper before coding implementations can help you better learn the internals without relying on code completion tools provided be an editor.

### Data Structures

* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Tries
* Graphs
* Stacks
* Queues
* Heaps
